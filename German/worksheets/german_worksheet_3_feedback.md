Questions
#4. Why "aus"?
- Aus means from => "coming out of". ALSO, aus is always dative.
#10. For this sentence, can the "neuen Kollegen" appear before "die guten Absichten"? Or cannot it not due to genetive and the intentions belong to the colleagues?
-Not really due to genetive possession. Pay attention to "of".
#13. Is "die schöne Stadt" accusative because of besuchen? Because they are actively visiting?
-Yes
#14. I think I missed the preposition for this once since I didnt get to traumen in the Anki cards yet at this point. I have now though! :)
#16. When is "auf" used with accusative? I assume this sentence had dative since its lying still.
- Climing a mountain, or putting a book *on* the table.
#17. What case is "ihre Unterstützung"?
"Für" takes accusative and this is a direct object.
#19. Why "bei" or "zur" here?

Notes for myself:
- Don't forget contractions with in, an, bei
- Weak declension for plurals are ALWAYS "n"!
- Dative plural *ALSO* takes an -n declension! 
- Remember reflexive verbs!
