Questions
#1. Why the "die" before Deutsche Gesischte?
- In German, you generally use the definite article when talking about abstract concepts or general topics
#2. Does using "bei" over "auf" change the meaning of the sentence?
- Bei seem to imply physically being at that location.
#7. I realized I wrote "Jacket" when I meant "Jacke". Would this be correct by chance? Or closer? Because I know its "die Jacke".
#8. Is "an" always akkusativ? Or is it specifically with "schreiben an"?
- Two way. For active actions, like writing to someone, it is akkusativ.
#8. Why is "am" missing before "besten"? When is it supposed to be used?
- Used for adverbs
#9. Wegen doesn't trigger Nebensatz huh?
- Preposition, not a conjunction
- Während can be both
#14. Why is "zu" not needed and why is the words after "gehören" dativ?
- gehören is always dativ
#15. Same question here...no Nebensatz?
#17. I dont think I understand the rules of this sentence at all
#18. Is it always an "s" at the end of a Genetiv noun? 
- For masculine and neutered
#19. Why "am"? 
- Bei is less common for "waiting at" and also suggests somewhere nearby
#20. Why is "the long class" dativ in this?
- Nach always take dativ
- aus, außer, bei, mit, nach, seit, von, zu

Notes for myself:
- Be more aware of 3rd person versions of verbs!
- Genetiv :( 
- Not sure when zu / für / über is used instead of other preposition. I think Im going for those since its the most analogous to English.
