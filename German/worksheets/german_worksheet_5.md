## Tips Before You Start

**Common patterns from previous worksheets:**
- "in" + building = "ins/in das" or "im/in dem" (ins Kino, im Restaurant)
- "zu" + person = "zu meiner Mutter" (BUT: "zum Arzt")
- Reflexive pronouns: ich ärgere MICH, du ärgerst DICH, er ärgert SICH
- Dative plural nouns: add -n if they don't already have it
- Genitive pattern: des/der/des/der + adjective-en + noun-(e)s for masc/neut

**Watch out for:**
- "in" vs "zu" for destinations (ins Kino, NOT zum Kino!)
- Reflexive verbs need "sich" (or mich/dich/uns/etc.)
- Preposition placement: stays WITH its object, not at the end
- Adjective endings in different cases
