Questions
#1. How is "zum Park" and "in den Park" different?
- In den is ACTUALLY into the park
- Zum is "in the direction of"
#6. Why is this in / bei rather than an?
- In = Inside
- Bei = at / near
- An Bahnhof is a set expression that breaks the typical notion of "an" being used for edge or on a surface.
- *Historically, train stations were outdoor platforms (edges/boundaries of the railway), so "an" (at/on) made sense. Even though modern stations are buildings, the expression stuck!*
#9. I think I just noticed this in the dictionary this is marked as "sich setzen". Was the reflexive missing here?
- Yuppp
#12. Is danken another one with a specific preposition?
- Danke takes dative by default, but "für" takes accusative
#15. Why is this "auf einer tropischen Insel" dative? There's no movement implied.
- Taking place at a location. Hence, dative. If you were dreaming about flying there, it would be accusative.
#16. Its not "den besorgten Patienten"? Its dative plural right?
- Whooops, I think this was because the last worksheets was plural.
#19. Again, why is Projekt accusative? Or is the movement implied by the schreibe?
- über + dative imply above / over something
#20. Declension on "gehören" follows the object that is being...belonged?
- Yes! Since this is the subject of the sentence. And the noun it belongs to is dative.


Notes for myself:
- Zu vs ins still
